## Webhook
The applet _Post a Tweet with the ESP8266_ by rffsantos16 in [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) was used to connect our NodeMCU ESP8266 to my twitter account @baguy_chan.

It was necessary to create a random number generator so Tweeter wouldn't block the warnings.

## Data
To verify the data, the applet _Automatically save every Tweet you post to a Google spreadsheet_ by leorstern was used to save every tweet to a Google spreadsheet in my Google Drive.
